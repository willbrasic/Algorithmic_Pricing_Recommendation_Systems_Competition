  ### Prerequisites

  The main dependencies are any recent version of MATLAB and version 11 or greater
  of C++.

  ### Installation

  ```bash
  # Clone the repository
  git clone https://github.com/willbrasic/Asymmetric_Multi-Agent_Reinforcement_Learning_Pricing_Competition.git

  # Navigate to the project directory
  cd Asymmetric_Multi-Agent_Reinforcement_Learning_Pricing_Competition
  ```

  ## Docker Image

  A Docker container is available for this project on Docker Hub. This container allows you to run the code contained in SARSA_Qlearning_C++_OOP without needing to install C++ or set up dependencies on your system. You will need to install Docker Desktop and have it running while executing the next two lines.

  ### Pull the Docker Image

  To use the containerized version, pull the Docker image from Docker Hub:

  ```bash
  docker pull willbrasic/sarsa_qlearning:latest
  ```

  ### Run Container

  To run the container, use the following line:

  ```bash
  docker run --rm willbrasic/sarsa_qlearning:latest
  ```
